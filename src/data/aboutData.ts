  about: `I'm a passionate Data Scientist and Full Stack Developer from Kolkata, currently based in Bengaluru. With a strong foundation in Machine Learning, AI, and modern web technologies, I love building solutions that make a real impact.

My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how things work under the hood. That curiosity led me to explore everything from neural networks to distributed systems, from frontend frameworks to cloud infrastructure.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, mentoring aspiring developers, or exploring the latest in AI research. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community.
